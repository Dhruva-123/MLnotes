1. Linear Models (Foundational)
These are your building blocks for almost every other model.

✅ Perceptron

✅ Adaline (SGD for regression)

✅ Linear Regression

✅ Logistic Regression (Binary + Multiclass softmax)

✅ Ridge Regression

✅ Lasso Regression

✅ Elastic Net

✅ Polynomial Regression

🔁 Learn: cost functions, gradient descent, closed-form vs iterative, regularization tradeoffs

2. Probabilistic Models
You’ll learn to model uncertainty, distributions, and generative processes.

✅ Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Bernoulli, Multinomial)

✅ Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA)

✅ Bayesian Linear Regression

✅ MAP vs MLE estimation

✅ Log-Likelihoods & prior/posterior math

You already started here. Now you go full-depth.

✅ Decision Trees (ID3, CART – Gini vs Entropy)

✅ Random Forests

✅ Extra Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees)

✅ Gradient Boosting (from scratch)

✅ XGBoost / LightGBM (black-box level + intuition)

🔁 Learn: bias–variance control, overfitting, feature bagging, ensemble stacking
