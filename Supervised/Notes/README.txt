Note that all the notes you see here on supervised learnings was an extract from a bundle of resources including, but not limited to, research papers, AI, YouTube tutorials. These do cover a lot of the theory, but if this information remains insufficient to you, I recommend you refer to the related research papers for the particular model which are listed in another repo of mine.
