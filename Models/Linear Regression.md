Linear Regression is the method that we use to train a computer to predict an output variable given an array of input variables. In order to make the most optimal prediction, we train the model such that the loss function is minimized. There is only 1 difference between linear regression and our standard gradient descent based classifiers, that is, in classifiers, we send the output into a sign(x) function that classifies data but here, the output is the desired metric. This is used usually for linear relationships.
